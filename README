Science Tools for MySQL
=======================

    Science-specific tools and extensions for SQL. Currently the project
contains user defined functions (UDFs) for MySQL including spatial geometry,
astronomy specific functions and mathematical functions.


Installation prerequisites:
---------------------------

- Python 2.5.x or later   (http://www.python.org/download/)
- MySQL server 5.x        (http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/)
- MySQLdb 1.2.x           (http://sourceforge.net/projects/mysql-python/)

MySQLdb, a Python DB API 2.0 implementation for MySQL, is only required
in order to run the unit tests.
 
In order to install the UDFs, you need write permission to the MySQL server
plug-in directory as well as a MySQL account with admin priviledges.


SciSQL configuration:
---------------------

    Run ./configure from the top-level SciSQL directory. Passing --help will
yield a list of configuration options. Here are the ones most likely to require
tweaking:

  --prefix        Set this to the top-level MySQL server install directory
  --mysql-user    Set this to the name of a MySQL admin user
  --mysql-socket  Set this to the name of the MySQL server UNIX socket file


Building and installation:
--------------------------

    SciSQL is built, installed, and uninstalled with the usual make,
make install, and make uninstall commands.

Note that install/uninstall will CREATE/DROP the SciSQL UDFs. You will
be prompted for the password of the MySQL admin user that was specified
during configuration.


Testing the SciSQL UDFs:
------------------------

    First of all, make sure you've got MySQLdb installed. Then run:

make test

Again, you'll be prompted for the password of the MySQL admin user that
you specified during configuration.


Reporting bugs and getting help:
--------------------------------
