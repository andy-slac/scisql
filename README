Science Tools for MySQL
=======================

    SciSQL provides science-specific tools and extensions for SQL. Currently,
the project contains user defined functions (UDFs) and stored procedures for
MySQL in the areas of spherical geometry, statistics, and photometry. It is
distributed under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License,
version 3.

    Note that the doc/index.html file in the SciSQL distribution contains
all the instructions below, as well as documentation for all the SciSQL UDFs
and stored procedures.


Installation prerequisites:
---------------------------

- Python 2.5.x or later   (http://www.python.org/download/)
- MySQL server 5.x        (http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/)
- MySQLdb 1.2.x           (http://sourceforge.net/projects/mysql-python/)
- Mako 0.4.x              (http://www.makotemplates.org/download.html)

MySQLdb, a Python DB API 2.0 implementation for MySQL, is only required
in order to run the unit tests. The Mako templating library is required only
if you wish to rebuild the HTML documentation.
 
In order to install the UDFs, you need write permission to the MySQL server
plug-in directory as well as a MySQL account with admin priviledges.


Databases reserved for SciSQL use:
----------------------------------

The following database names are reserved for use by SciSQL:

- scisql                  Contains SciSQL stored procedures.
- scisql_test             Used by SciSQL unit tests.
- scisql_demo             Contains sample data that can be used to
                          exercise the SciSQL UDFs.

The scisql_demo databases is dropped and re-created during installation. If you
are using it for other things, you must migrate its contents to a different
database prior to installing SciSQL. If you do not, YOU WILL LOSE DATA.

Even though the scisql and scisql_test databases are never automatically
dropped, their use is STRONGLY DISCOURAGED.


SciSQL configuration:
---------------------

    Run ./configure from the top-level SciSQL directory. Passing --help will
yield a list of configuration options. Here are the ones most likely to require
tweaking:

  --prefix        Set this to the top-level MySQL server install directory
  --mysql-user    Set this to the name of a MySQL admin user
  --mysql-socket  Set this to the name of the MySQL server UNIX socket file
  --scisql-prefix This string will be used as a prefix for all sciSQL UDF
                  and stored procedure names. You can specify an empty
                  string, which will result in unprefixed names. The
                  default is "scisql_".

You will be prompted for the MySQL admin user password during configuration.
Connection details, including this password, are stored in
build/c4che/.my.cnf in the MySQL options file format. This allows various
build steps to connect to MySQL without constantly prompting for a password.

Even though the .my.cnf file permissions are set such that only its creator
is allowed read/write access, for security reasons it is still recommended to
run `make distclean` once SciSQL has been installed. This will remove the
entire build directory and its contents.

If you wish to build/install only the SciSQL client utilities and documentation,
run configure with the --client-only option. In this case, a MySQL server or
client install is not required, the only executable generated is scisql_index
(a utility which generates HTM indexes for tables of circles or polygons stored
in tab-separated-value format), and --prefix can be set to a directory of your
choice.


Building and installation:
--------------------------

    SciSQL is built, installed, and uninstalled with the usual make,
make install, and make uninstall commands.

The install command will CREATE the SciSQL UDFs, stored procedures, and
databases (including the scisql_demo database). It will also automatically
run the SciSQL unit tests. You can re-run the tests anytime with `make test`.

You may wish to regenerate the HTML documentation if you've chosen a 
non-default value for --scisql-prefix, as the HTML distributed with release
tar-balls is built under the assumption that --scisql-prefix="scisql_".
To do this, run `make html_docs`.

Finally, note that after installation each UDF will be available under two
names: one including a version number and one without. For example, assuming
that --scisql-prefix="foo_" and that the sciSQL version number is 1.2.3,
a hypothetical UDF named "bar" would be available as:

    foo_bar
    foo_bar_1_2_3

The uninstall command will drop the versioned SciSQL UDFs and stored
procedures. It will also drop the unversioned UDFs/procedures, but only
if the unversioned UDF/procedure was created by the version of
sciSQL being uninstalled. As a consequence, it is possible to have
multiple versions of sciSQL installed at the same time, and the behavior
of two versions can be compared from within a single MySQL instance.
An unversioned name will resolve to the most recently installed versioned
name.

The uninstall command will also drop the scisql_demo database.
