Science Tools for MySQL
=======================

    SciSQL provides science-specific tools and extensions for SQL. Currently,
the project contains user defined functions (UDFs) and stored procedures for
MySQL in the areas of spherical geometry, statistics, and photometry. It is
distributed under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License,
version 3.

    Note that the doc/index.html file in the SciSQL distribution contains
all the instructions below, as well as documentation for all the SciSQL UDFs
and stored procedures.


Installation prerequisites:
---------------------------

- Python 2.5.x or later   (http://www.python.org/download/)
- MySQL server 5.x        (http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/)
- MySQLdb 1.2.x           (http://sourceforge.net/projects/mysql-python/)
- Mako                    (http://www.makotemplates.org/download.html)

MySQLdb, a Python DB API 2.0 implementation for MySQL, is only required
in order to run the unit tests. The Mako template engine is required only
for developers that wish to rebuild the HTML documentation.
 
In order to install the UDFs, you need write permission to the MySQL server
plug-in directory as well as a MySQL account with admin priviledges.


Databases reserved for SciSQL use:
----------------------------------

The following database names are reserved for use by SciSQL:

- scisql                  Contains SciSQL stored procedures.
- scisql_test             Used by SciSQL unit tests.
- scisql_demo             Contains sample data that can be used to
                          exercise the SciSQL UDFs.

The scisql and scisql_demo databases are dropped and re-created during
installation. If you are using these databases for other things,
you must migrate their contents to a different database prior to installing
SciSQL. If you do not, YOU WILL LOSE DATA.


SciSQL configuration:
---------------------

    Run ./configure from the top-level SciSQL directory. Passing --help will
yield a list of configuration options. Here are the ones most likely to require
tweaking:

  --prefix        Set this to the top-level MySQL server install directory
  --mysql-user    Set this to the name of a MySQL admin user
  --mysql-socket  Set this to the name of the MySQL server UNIX socket file

You will be prompted for the MySQL admin user password during configuration.
Connection details, including this password, are stored in
build/c4che/.my.cnf in the MySQL options file format. This allows various
build steps to connect to MySQL without constantly prompting for a password.

Even though the .my.cnf file permissions are set such that only its creator
is allowed read/write access, for security reasons it is still recommended to
run `make distclean` once SciSQL has been installed. This will remove the
entire build directory and its contents.

If you wish to build/install only the SciSQL client utilities and documentation,
run configure with the --client-only option. In this case, a MySQL server or
client install is not required, the only executable generated is scisql_index
(a utility which generates HTM indexes for tables of circles or polygons stored
in tab-separated-value format), and --prefix can be set to a directory of your
choice.


Building and installation:
--------------------------

    SciSQL is built, installed, and uninstalled with the usual make,
make install, and make uninstall commands.

The install command will CREATE the SciSQL UDFs, stored procedures, and
databases (including the scisql_demo database). It will also automatically
run the SciSQL unit tests. You can re-run the tests anytime with `make test`.

The uninstall command DROP the SciSQL UDFs, stored procedures, and databases.


Reporting bugs and getting help:
