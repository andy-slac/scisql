Science Tools for MySQL
=======================

    Science-specific tools and extensions for SQL. Currently the project
contains user defined functions (UDFs) for MySQL including spatial geometry,
astronomy specific functions and mathematical functions.


Installation prerequisites:
---------------------------

- Python 2.5.x or later   (http://www.python.org/download/)
- MySQL server 5.x        (http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/)
- MySQLdb 1.2.x           (http://sourceforge.net/projects/mysql-python/)

MySQLdb, a Python DB API 2.0 implementation for MySQL, is only required
in order to run the unit tests.
 
In order to install the UDFs, you need write permission to the MySQL server
plug-in directory as well as a MySQL account with admin priviledges.


SciSQL configuration:
---------------------

    Run ./configure from the top-level SciSQL directory. Passing --help will
yield a list of configuration options. Here are the ones most likely to require
tweaking:

  --prefix        Set this to the top-level MySQL server install directory
  --mysql-user    Set this to the name of a MySQL admin user
  --mysql-socket  Set this to the name of the MySQL server UNIX socket file

You will be prompted for the MySQL admin user password during configuration.
Connection details, including this password, are stored in
build/c4che/.my.cnf in the MySQL options file format. This allows various
build steps to connect to MySQL without constantly prompting for a password.

Though the .my.cnf file permissions are set such that only the creator is
allowed read/write access, for security reasons it is still recommended to
run `make distclean` once SciSQL has been installed - this will remove the
entire build directory and its contents.


Building and installation:
--------------------------

    SciSQL is built, installed, and uninstalled with the usual make,
make install, and make uninstall commands.

Note that install/uninstall will CREATE/DROP the SciSQL UDFs. The install
command will also automatically run the test cases. You can re-run the
tests anytime with `make test`.


Reporting bugs and getting help:
--------------------------------
